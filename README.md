# MitoLipoLink3.0
MitoLipoLink3.0 is a "one-click" tool designed for the quantitative analysis of spatial interactions between Lipid Droplets and Mitochondria.
Key Features:

One-Click Analysis: Automatically calculates Pearson correlation, Manders' coefficients (M1 & M2), and interaction coefficients (Area/Count).

Visual Validation: Outputs pseudo-color maps and boundary detection to visually verify the segmented regions.

Adjustable Thresholds: Offers three quality levels (Low, Medium, High) to adapt to different image clarities and refine segmentation.

Comprehensive Stats: Provides detailed data including region counts, pixel areas, and the total number of interacting droplets.
