MitoLipoLink 3.0 is a "one-click" tool designed for the quantitative analysis of spatial interactions between **Lipid Droplets** and **Mitochondria**.

## ✨ Key Features
* **One-Click Analysis**: Automatically calculates Pearson correlation, Manders' coefficients (M1 & M2), and interaction coefficients (Area/Count).
* **Visual Validation**: Outputs pseudo-color maps and boundary detection to visually verify the segmented regions.
* **Adjustable Thresholds**: Offers three quality levels (Low, Medium, High) to adapt to different image clarities and refine segmentation.
* **Comprehensive Stats**: Provides detailed data including region counts, pixel areas, and the total number of interacting droplets.
